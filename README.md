## Calendar for Advent and Christmas

The below table outlines the choral music selections for Advent and Christmas.

Note that page numbers indicate the _printed_ page numbers on the page itself, not the PDF internal numbering.

Some small changes may occur as we near the service dates. If that happens, I will do my best to update this table accordingly.

## What are we singing?

In the Western liturgical tradition (of which we as Anglicans take part), the part of the choir is to sing the **Mass propers**.

The propers are a set of sung liturgical texts, each of which correspond with the day in the church calendar and accompany or ornament a liturgical action.

Each day's propers are typically based in Scripture and often derived from the Psalms. They often relate with the texts of the lectionary and display the wonderful interconnectedness of the written Word.

These are the propers:

- Introit
- Gradual
- Alleluia (replaced by Tract during Lent)
- Offertory
- Communion

Additional propers exist such as Sequences and Tropes. For our purposes, we will focus on the five given above.

<!-- Below we will examine the propers one by one.

### Introit

"Introit" is a Latin word meaning "he/she/it enters." It is fundamentally tied to the liturgical action of entrance. In ancient times, it was chanted during the procession and censing of the altar, marking the beginning of the Mass itself.
